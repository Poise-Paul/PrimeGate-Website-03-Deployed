                  Hunting for an apartment to rent without using property agents
                  might sound like a fun thing to do; especially since it would
                  save you the extra money you would have spent hiring real
                  estate agents. However, while this might save you money, it
                  leaves you prone to mistakes and regrets.

                      Like a human body without white blood cells, trying to
                      rent an apartment without using property agents makes you
                      vulnerable. Homeowners are largely men/women who expect to
                      cash in on their property by making as much money as they
                      can regardless of the condition of the house, its
                      location, facilities and other details that a real estate
                      agent would naturally be on the lookout for.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      You should, however, bear in mind that using property
                      agents has both advantages and disadvantages for you as a
                      renter. We have highlighted them in detail in this piece
                      and will start with the disadvantages of using real estate
                      agents.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>
                      <p>Disadvantages of Using Property Agents</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                      Working with real estate agents when hunting for an
                      apartment to rent comes with a wealth of benefits.
                      However, before you hire one, ensure you are very clear on
                      your budget as well as your preferences. Below are the
                      cons of using property agents:
                    </p>
                    <img
                      src="assets/img/blog/blog-inner-01.jpg"
                      class="img-fluid"
                      alt=""
                    />
                    <h3>1. The Looming Feeling of Distrust</h3>
                    <p>
                      As someone looking to rent an apartment, it’s perfectly
                      okay if you have a feeling that a real estate agent
                      doesn’t have your interest at heart. This is a perfectly
                      natural; especially when you consider the fact that the
                      same agent might be protecting the interest of the
                      landlord/homeowner more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In many cases, you are likely to find yourself not
                      trusting the real estate agents 100%. This is not
                      necessarily your fault especially when you realise that
                      the agent also has his/her own interest to protect. Even
                      when you get a good deal from the agent, you might be
                      reluctant to commit entirely to it simply because you just
                      don’t trust him/her. This is a huge disadvantage when
                      using property agents to hunt for an apartment.
                    </p>
                    <img
                      src="assets/img/blog/blog-inner-02.jpg"
                      class="img-fluid"
                      alt=""
                    />
                    <h3>2. Missing Out on Information</h3>
                    <p>
                      Using property agents means you have to rely on them as a
                      middleman between you and the seller. In many cases, you
                      will not be contacting the homeowner directly since you
                      are working with an agent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The disadvantage of this is that you are likely to miss
                      out on information that you would have had access to if
                      you were in direct communication with the landlord. In
                      several cases, such information is not disclosed to you
                      until you ask questions. This is why it is supremely
                      important to ask questions when renting an apartment.
                    </p>
                    <img
                      src="assets/img/blog/blog-inner-03.jpg"
                      class="img-fluid"
                      alt=""
                    />
                    <h3>3. Overpaying</h3>
                    <p>
                      Before a real estate agent approaches homeowners on your
                      behalf, you should provide the agent with a breakdown of
                      precisely what you want. Such details would include your
                      preferred location, the number of bedrooms, the amenities
                      that sit on top of your list of priorities and many more.
                      It then becomes the responsibility of the agent to
                      represent you when speaking to landlords.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The danger of this is that if you become desperate to rent
                      any particular apartment, this can end up working against
                      you. For instance, if you are working with a really fat
                      budget, real estate agents could exploit this to the point
                      where you end up overpaying for the property.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It is quite easy for a property agent to convince a
                      homeowner to make you pay more as rent by increasing what
                      he/she is asking for. Such anomalies can only happen when
                      working with a property agent.
                    </p>

                      alt=""
                    />
                    <h3>4. Priority</h3>
                    <p>
                      Renting an apartment might be really high on your
                      priority, which is why you’re probably trying to dedicate
                      time to it. This, however, does not mean that a property
                      agent would push you to the top of his/her list of
                      ‘priority client.’ Most times, you would have to work with
                      the timelines communicated to you by the agent. If your
                      personal timelines are not flexible, this could be a snag.

                    <h3>1. More Options</h3>
                    <p>
                      A real estate agent will ensure that you get a richer pool
                      of alternative apartments to choose from as opposed to
                      searching by yourself. Regardless of your preferences, an
                      agent has a strong network of property owners who are
                      looking to rent out their homes and you can always rely on
                      this to get several apartments to choose from.
                    </p>

                    />
                    <h3>2. You Can Buy Experience</h3>
                    <p>
                      Using property agents does not give you a deeper pool of
                      apartments to choose from, you also get to enjoy the
                      benefits that come with working with someone whose
                      experience is strong enough to give you a reliable history
                      of the apartments under consideration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The agent will also be on the lookout for anything that
                      can constitute a red flag and ensure you’re making
                      informed decisions. When it comes to pricing, the value of
                      an agent cannot be overemphasised. Instead of guessing or
                      falling into the traps of greedy homeowners, the agent
                      will let you know what you typically should be paying for
                      an apartment.
                    </p>
                    <h3>3. Absorbing Pressure</h3>
                    <p>
                      Instead of finding yourself in a situation where you have
                      to meet a property owner to negotiate how much you are
                      expected to pay as rent, the property agent takes this
                      pressure off you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Going back and forth with a property owner can be very
                      demanding especially if you are dealing with an aggressive
                      landlord who is highly skilled in the art of negotiation.
                      Remember that an agent knows the market and what is
                      generally obtainable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The agent also ensures that emotions are kept under check
                      as a direct involvement with an emotional landlord could
                      stand in the way of what could be a good deal for you.
                    </p>
                    <h3>4. Market Knowledge</h3>
                    <p>
                      There is a clear difference between a sellers’ market and
                      a buyers’ market. In a buyers’ market, what you have is a
                      situation in which supply exceeds demand, giving
                      purchasers an advantage over sellers in price
                      negotiations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In a sellers’ market on the other hand, what you have is
                      quite the opposite of a buyers’ market. Here, what you
                      have is a situation in which demand far exceeds supply and
                      owners have an advantage over buyers in price
                      negotiations. Real estate agents understand this and how
                      it works, which is why working with them puts you at an
                      advantage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      An agent is also likely to share market insights and
                      knowledge with you, which could help you get a better deal
                      from the property owner. Remember how this can be a
                      disadvantage if the information is shared with the seller?
                      This time, it works to your advantage, which is why it’s
                      important to work with an agent you can trust.
                    </p>

                      src="assets/img/blog/blog-inner-saves-time.jpg"
                      class="img-fluid"
                      alt=""
                    />
                    <h3>5. Saves Time</h3>
                    <p>
                      How much time would you have to sacrifice if you were to
                      visit several neighbourhoods to check out the homes and to
                      assess the cost of renting them? That would require an
                      awful amount of time. One way to avoid dedicating so much
                      time to such a search is to work with a real estate agent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      You can save even more time by ensuring that you are very
                      clear on what you want. When the agent asks you for what
                      you want, don’t start by saying: “Maybe a 2 bedroom flat,
                      a 4-bedroom flat or a self-contained apartment.” Such an
                      answer just shows that you have not decided on what you
                      want.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In a case you have not made up your mind, tell the agent
                      what your budget is and provide additional details; like
                      whether you will be living alone or moving in with your
                      significant half. This puts the agent in a position where
                      he/she can guide you based on your needs.
                    </p>

                    />
                    <h3>6. Legality</h3>
                    <p>
                      Renting an apartment has a legal side to it. It is not
                      enough to simply pay for an apartment and move in 2 days
                      after. There are vital documents and charges involved in
                      renting an apartment. For instance, before you rent an
                      apartment, you need to sign a lease agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Going through the entire process of renting an apartment
                      by yourself puts you in a situation where the landlord has
                      room to have the upper hand. This might not really matter
                      if the homeowner is a straightforward person. However, in
                      a case where the landlord is shady, you might get burnt.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      From the pros and cons, you can see that using real estate
                      agents has both advantages and disadvantages but the as
                      you might have guessed, the pros clearly outweigh the
                      cons.
